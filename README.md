### QuonkScript ###

This project is a study in building an interpreted language, building off the [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_2VhOvlMk4UHGqYCLWc6GO8FaPl8fQTh) by tylerlaceby, implemented in Go instead of TypeScript.

## Todo:

    Pos, End fields for position in src for sake of error messages
    Move error messages to consts in file
